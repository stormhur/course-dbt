  - name: dim_order_products
    description: A view that stores each unique order_id with associated product information. All product names and costs are stored as comma separated strings. Index of value in comma separated list matches (meaning product name index 1 == product price index 1).

  - name: dim_users
    description: A view that stores each user with associated address and user metadata. Each user could potentially have many addresses, so all address data is stored as an aggregated comma-separated list string. Please note that indices match (i.e., associated address id index 1 == associated country index 1)
